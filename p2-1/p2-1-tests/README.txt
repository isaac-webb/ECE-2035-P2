This folder has the compiled object file for our suite of DLL tests, the gtest binary archive, and a test script to compile against these. 

To run, copy your doubley_linked_list.h and doubely_linked_list.cpp into this folder, and run the command
   ./test_build.sh

If necessary, give the script execute permissions:
    chmod +x ./test_build.sh
